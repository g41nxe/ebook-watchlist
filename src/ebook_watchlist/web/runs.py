"""Starting a Run from the Dashboard, and saying what became of it (Ticket 10).

The Run does not happen in the web process (ADR 3). This module spawns
``python -m ebook_watchlist.run --trigger ui`` as a detached child and then
answers one question for the page: *what is that Run doing right now?*

Three things make that question harder than it looks, and each is answered by a
different piece of evidence:

- **Is a Run already going?** The file lock is the only authority, and only Run
  processes ever touch it (the web process must never hold it). So we do not
  ask: we start the child and let it bounce off the lock itself, which it does
  by exiting 0 without writing a run row. That is race-free by construction.
- **Did the Run get off the ground at all?** A bad Profile makes the Run exit
  before it writes anything to the journal. The journal therefore cannot report
  it; the child's own exit code and output can, so a launch is remembered until
  a run row supersedes it.
- **Is a Run that never finished still alive?** An unfinished row looks the
  same whether the Run is working or was killed. The Run signs its row with its
  pid, so the answer is whether that process still exists.

The remembered launch lives in this process and nowhere else. Restarting the
web app forgets it and falls back to the journal — which is correct: the Run is
a separate process and carries on regardless (ADR 3).
